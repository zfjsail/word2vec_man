the name comes either from the latin movere to move or a latinized version of old french mot word or verbal utterance the mediaeval latin for motet is motectum if from the latin the name describes the movement of the different voices against one another according to margaret bent one nine nine seven a piece of music in several parts with words is as precise a definition of the motet as will serve from the thirteenth to the late sixteenth century and beyond this is actually very close to one of the earliest descriptions we have that of the late thirteenth century theorist johannes de grocheio grocheio was also one of the first scholars to define a motet grocheio believed that the motet was not intended for the vulgar who do not understand its finer points and derive no pleasure from hearing it it is meant for educated people and those who look for refinement in art medieval motets the earliest motets arose in the thirteenth century bent one nine nine seven out of the organum tradition exemplified in the notre dame school of l onin and p rotin the motet arose from discant clausula sections usually strophic interludes in a longer sequence of organum to which upper voices were added usually the discant represented a strophic sequence in latin which was sung as a discant over a cantus firmus which typically was a gregorian chant fragment with different words from the discant the motet took a definite rhythm from the words of the verse and as such appeared as a brief rhythmic interlude in the middle of the longer more chantlike organum the practice of discant over a cantus firmus marked the beginnings of counterpoint in western music from these first motets arose a medieval tradition of secular motets these were two or three part compositions in which several different texts sometimes in different vernacular languages were sung simultaneously over a latin cantus firmus that once again was usually adapted from a passage of gregorian chant it is suspected that for the sake of intelligibility in performance the cantus firmus and one or another of the vocal lines were performed on instruments increasingly in the one four th and one five th centuries motets tended to be isorhythmic that is they employed repeated rhythmic patterns in all voices not just the cantus firmus which did not necessarily coincide with repeating melodic patterns philippe de vitry was one of the earliest composers to use this technique and his work evidently had an influence on that of guillaume de machaut one of the most famous named composers of late medieval motets renaissance motets the name of the motet was preserved in the transition from medieval to renaissance music but the character of the composition was entirely changed while it grew out of the medieval isorhythmic motet the renaissance composers of the motet generally abandoned the use of a repeated figure as a cantus firmus guillaume dufay was a transitional figure he wrote one of the last motets in the medieval isorhythmic style the nuper rosarum flores which premiered in one four three six and was written to commemorate the completion of filippo brunelleschi s dome in the cathedral of florence during this time however the use of canti firmi in works such as the parody mass tended to stretch the cantus firmus out to great lengths compared to the multivoice descant above it this tended to obscure the rhythm supplied by the cantus firmus that is apparent in the medieval isorhythmic motet the cascading passing chords created by the interplay between multiple voices and the absence of a strong or obvious beat are the features that distinguish medieval and renaissance vocal styles instead the renaissance motet is a short polyphonic musical setting in imitative counterpoint for chorus of a religious text not specifically connected to the liturgy of a given day and therefore suitable for use in any service the texts of antiphons were frequently used as motet texts this is the sort of composition that is most familiarly named by the name of motet and the renaissance period marked the flowering of the form in essence these motets were sacred madrigals the relationship between the two forms is most obvious in the composers who concentrated on sacred music especially giovanni pierluigi da palestrina whose motets setting texts from the canticum canticorum the biblical song of solomon are among the most lush and madrigal like of palestrina s compositions while his madrigals that set poems of petrarch in praise of the blessed virgin mary would not be out of place in church the language of the text was the decisive feature if it s latin it s a motet if the vernacular a madrigal religious compositions in vernacular languages were often called madrigali spirituali spiritual madrigals like most madrigals renaissance motets developed in episodic format with separate phrases of the source text being given independent melodic treatment and contrapuntal development contrapuntal passages often alternate with monody secular motets continued to be written these motets typically set a latin text in praise of a monarch or commemorating some public triumph the themes of courtly love often found in the medieval secular motet were banished from the renaissance motet this was one of the pre eminent forms of renaissance music other important composers of renaissance motets include alexander agricola gilles binchois antoine busnois william byrd johannes vodnianus campanus loyset comp re josquin des prez john dunstable antoine de f vin francisco guerrero nicolas gombert heinrich isaac pierre de la rue orlando di lasso crist bal de morales jean mouton jacob obrecht johannes ockeghem giovanni pierluigi da palestrina thomas tallis john taverner tom s luis de victoria in the latter part of the one six th century giovanni gabrieli and other composers developed a new style the polychoral motet in which two or more choirs of singers or instruments alternated this style of motet was sometimes called the venetian motet to distinguish it from the netherlands or flemish motet written elsewhere baroque motets the name motet was preserved into baroque music especially in france where the word was applied to petits motets sacred choral compositions whose only accompaniment was a basso continuo and grands motets which included instruments up to and including a full orchestra jean baptiste lully was an important composer of this sort of motet lully s motets often included parts for soloists as well as choirs they were longer including multiple movement in which different soloist choral or instrumental forces were employed lully s motets also continued the renaissance tradition of semi secular latin motets in works such as plaude laetare gallia written to celebrate the baptism of king louis xiv s son its text by pierre perrin begins plaude laetare gallia rore caelesti rigantur lilia sacro delphinus fonte lavatur et christianus christo dicatur rejoice and sing france the lily is bathed with heavenly dew the dauphin is bathed in the sacred font and the christian is dedicated to christ in germany too pieces called motets were written in the new musical languages of the baroque heinrich sch tz wrote many motets in a series of publications called symphoniae sacrae some in latin and some in german johann sebastian bach also wrote six surviving works he called motets bach s motets were relatively long pieces in german on sacred themes for choir and basso continuo bach s motets are bwv two two five singet dem

verum corpus is in this genre in the one nine th century german composers continued to write motets occasionally notably johannes brahms in german and anton bruckner in latin french composers of motets included camille saint sa ns and c sar franck similar compositions in the english language are called anthems but some later english composers such as charles villiers stanford wrote motets in latin the majority of these compositions are a cappella but some are accompanied by organ in the two zero th century composers of motets have been conscious imitators of earlier styles such as ralph

merlin merlinus and merlyn is the personage best known as the mighty wizard featured in accounts of king arthur starting with geoffrey of monmouth s historia regum britanniae other accounts describe a far different merlin merlin dictating his poems as illustrated in a french book from the one three th century indeed some texts clearly distinguish two different figures named merlin for example the welsh triads state there were three baptisimal bards taliesin chief of bards myrddin wyllt and myrddin emrys if these two bards called myrddin were originally variants of the same figure their stories have become so different in the earliest texts that we have about them that they are best treated as separate characters even though similar incidents are ascribed to both merlinus caledonensis myrddin wyllt this myrddin had nothing to do with arthur and flourished after the arthurian period the earliest welsh poems that concern the myrddin legend present him as a madman living a wretched existence in the caledonian forest ruminating on his former existence and the disaster that brought him low the death of his lord gwenddolau whom he served as bard the allusions in these poems serve to sketch out the events of the battle of arfderydd where rhydderch hael king of rheged slaughtered the forces of gwenddolau and myrddin went mad watching this defeat the annales cambriae date this battle to ad five seven three and name gwenddolau s adversaries as gwrgi and peredur the sons of eliffer a version of this legend is preserved in a late fifteenth century manuscript in a story called lailoken and kentigern in this narrative st kentigern meets in a deserted place with a naked hairy madman who is called lailoken although said by some to be called merlynum or merlin who declares that he has been condemned for his sins to wander in the company of beasts he added that he had been the cause for the deaths of all of the persons killed in the battle fought on the plain between liddel and carwannok having told his story the madman lept up and fled from the presence of the saint back into the wilderness he appears several times more in the narrative until at last asking st kentigern for the sacrament prophesying that he was about to die a triple death after some hesitation the saint granted the madman s wish and later that day the shepherds of king meldred captured him beat him with clubs then cast him into the river tweed where his body was pierced by a stake thus fulfilling his prophecy welsh literature has many examples of a prophetic literature predicting the military victory of all of the celtic peoples of britain who will join together and drive the english and later the normans also back into the sea some of these works were claimed to be the prophecies of myrddin some of it was not as for example the armes prydein this wild prophetic merlin was also treated by geoffrey of monmouth in his vita merlini which looks like a close adaptation of a number of myrddin poems a scottish example of the legend of merlin comes from five seven seven which was the year of the battle of arderyth this was a battle between fierce enemies rydderych the bountiful king of strathclyde and aeddam the perfidious king of kintyre while few have heard of the main protagonists among aidan s contingent was the celtic bard merlin merlin s patron gwenddolan was killed during the battle in which he was awarded for his verses recording the battle merlin ambrosius myrddin emrys it was geoffrey of monmouth who introduced merlin into the myths of king arthur the name myrddin is altered to merlin to avoid a resemblance to the obscene french word merde meaning excrement while geoffrey is remembered most for his character of arthur it was merlin whom he concentrated on making the prophetic bard a central character of his three books prophetiae merlini historiae regum britanniae and vita merlini as a result of this second book where merlin appears in the tales of the king vortigern aurelius ambrosius and uther pendragon who reigned immediately before arthur merlin in some later works also became a character in tales of arthur geoffrey tells only two tales of merlin merlin is begotten on a king s daughter by a demon and the episode is now placed at carmarthen in welsh caer myrddin as a young boy he was already known for his prophetic abilities and was consulted by king vortigern to explain why his castle would collapse every time it was rebuilt he revealed there was an underground lake with two sleeping dragons a white one and red one and explained they respectively represented the saxons and britons and portent for things to come nennius had recorded this tale in the historia britonum of the nine th century but attached it to aurelius ambrosius rather than merlin geoffrey conflated the two sages and incorporated them into his work simply and baldly stating that merlin was also called ambrosius to cover over his changing of nennius a long section of prophecy is added at this point the first tale tells how merlin created stonehenge as a burial place for aurelius ambrosius the second tale tells how by shape changing magic merlin enabled uther pendragon to enter into tintagel in disguise and father his son arthur these episodes also appear in many later adaptations of geoffrey s account somewhat later the poet robert de boron retold this material in his poem merlin with many expansions but with details garbled and changed in a way that suggests that the version of wace who adapted geoffrey s account into anglo norman had entered oral tradition and that this oral tradition was what robert knew along with some other merlin tales only a few lines of the poem have survived but a prose retelling became popular and was later incorporated into two other romances in robert s account merlin is begotten by a devil from hell on a virgin as an intended antichrist but his expectant mother advised by her confessor and counsellor blaise who realised what was amiss had the boy baptized at birth to foil this satanic plot however being half demon merlin still had tremendous magical powers to know what was happening past and present and god himself gave him prophetic knowledge of the future robert de boron lays great emphasis on merlin s power to change his shape on his joking personality and on his connection to the grail this text introduces merlin s master blaise who is pictured as writing merlin s deeds which merlin dictates to him explaining how they came to be known and preserved it also connects merlin with the holy grail as the arthurian mythos was retold and embellished upon merlin s prophetic aspects were sometimes de emphasized in favor of portraying merlin as a wizard and elder advisor to arthur on the other hand in prose lancelot it is said that merlin was never baptized and never did any good in his life only evil medieval arthurian tales abound in inconsistencies in the prose lancelot and later accounts merlin s eventual downfall came from his lusting after a woman named nimue who coaxed his magical secrets from him eventually turning the magic he had taught her against him and imprisoning him either in a cave where he died or in a magical and invisible palace where he may live still this was unfortunate for arthur depriving him of merlin s counsel there are three such accounts of merlin in arthur s day which also cover the early days of arthur s reign the earliest known as the vulgate merlin includes robert de boron s merlin it was intended as a sort of prequel to the three romances of the lancelot grail cycle an incomplete variant version known as the book of arthur also exists the second is sometimes called the huth merlin or the post vulgate suite du merlin it is part of a long prose romance that has not survived intact but which is now known as the book of the grail or the post vulgate cycle intended as an entire history of the grail and of arthur and his knights this also includes robert de boron s merlin the third work is called the prophecies of merlin and contains long prophecies of merlin mostly concerned with thirteenth century italian politics some by his ghost after his death the prophecies are interspersed with episodes relating merlin s deeds and with various arthurian adventures in which merlin does not appear at all later

categorised into two types a wholesale merchant operates in the chain between producer and retail merchant some wholesale merchants only organise the movement of goods rather than move the goods themselves a retail merchant sells commodities to consumers including businesses commonly known as retailers a shop owner is a retail merchant a merchant class characterises many pre modern societies its status can range from high even achieving titles like that of merchant prince or nabob to low such as in chinese culture due to the soiling capabilities of profiting from mere trade rather than from the labour of others reflected in agricultural produce and tribute under the common law and the uniform commercial code in the united states merchants are held to a higher standard in the selling of products than those who are not engaged in the sale of goods as a profession for example when a merchant sells something he or she is deemed to give an implied warranty of merchantability

star for bodies with a size scale larger than the atmospheric mean free path one zero cm to several meters the visibility is due to the heat produced by the ram pressure not friction as is commonly assumed of atmospheric entry since the majority of meteors are from small sand grain size meteoroid bodies most visible signatures are caused by dexcitation following the individual collisions between vaporized meteor atoms and atmospheric constituents a very bright meteor may be called a fireball or bolide the international meteor organisation defines fireballs as being meteors of magnitude three or brighter the meteor section of the british astronomical association on the other hand has a much stricter definition requiring the meteor to be magnitude five or brighter if a meteoroid survives its transit of the atmosphere to come to rest on the surface the resulting object is called a meteorite a meteor striking the earth or other object may produce an impact crater molten terrestrial material splashed from such a crater can cool and solidify into an object known as a tektite meteor dust particles left by falling meteoroids can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months these particles might affect climate both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere ionization trails during the entry of a meteoroid into the upper atmosphere an ionization trail is created where the molecules in the upper atmosphere are ionized by the passage of the meteor such ionization trails can last up to four five minutes at a time small sand grain sized meteoroids are entering the atmosphere constantly essentially every few seconds in a given region and thus ionization trails can be found in the upper atmosphere more or less continuously when radio waves are bounced off these trails it is called meteor scatter communication meteor scatter has been used for experimental secure military battlefield communications systems the basic idea of such a system is that such an ion trail will act as a mirror for radio waves which can be bounced off the trail security arises from the fact that as a mirror only receivers in the correct position will hear the transmitter much as with a real mirror what is seen in reflection depends upon one s position with respect to the mirror because the sporadic nature of meteor entry such systems are limited to low data rates typically four five nine six zero zero baud amateur radio operators sometimes use meteor scatter communication on vhf bands snowpack information from the sierra nevada mountains in california is transmitted from remote sites via meteor scatter meteor radars can measure atmospheric density and winds by measuring the decay rate and doppler shift of a meteor trail large meteoroids can leave behind very large ionization trails which then interact with the earth s magnetic field as the trail dissipates megawatts of electromagnetic energy can be released with a peak in the power spectrum at audio frequencies curiously although the waves are electromagnetic they can be heard they are powerful enough to make grasses plants eyeglass frames

year in one nine seven eight milken returned to his home state of california during the one nine eight zero s he became known as a controversial financial innovator whose work at investment bank drexel burnham lambert inc greatly expanded the use of high yield debt junk bonds in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions which fueled the one nine eight zero s leveraged buyout boom through his business acumen the network of contacts and clients and the trust he had earned from buy side investors buyers of primary market debt issues as well as milken s issuance of the highly confident

hybrids and scores of other financial instruments in more than a dozen asset classes to help clients grow legal charges in one nine eight nine rudy giuliani the united states attorney for the southern district of new york charged him under the rico act with nine eight counts of racketeering and fraud and he was indicted by a federal grand jury after a plea bargain milken pled guilty to six lesser securities and reporting violations he paid a two zero zero million fine and another four zero zero million in settlements relating primarily to civil lawsuits he was banned for life from the securities industry judge kimba wood at milken s sentencing told him you were willing to commit only crimes that were unlikely to be detected when a man of your power in the financial world repeatedly conspires to violate and violates securities and tax business in order to achieve more power and wealth for himself a significant prison term is required wood recommended a one zero year prison sentence of which in her opinion milken should have served at least three six to four zero months however milken served only about two two months from march one nine nine one to january one nine nine

boesky s false one three d statement milken suggested that ivan boesky buy mca stock to hide that golden nugget was selling and to assure him no loss in a sale to drexel helped a client reduce his income tax liability by selling him two investments and then buying them back at a lower price failed to disclose in written form an agreed upon adjustment in transaction prices between drexel and a client after prison term upon his release milken resumed his philanthropic activities keeping the focus on education and medical research he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the same month he was released from prison january one nine nine three assessments of milken s accomplishments judgments of milken s accomplishments namely whether they were good for the u s economy or if they were ethical tend to depend on the ideology of the observer and usually fall within two groups milken s supporters tend to be libertarian including bank of sweden prize winning economist milton friedman generally speaking this group argues as friedman did in his one nine seven one article does business have social responsibility that no special moral obligations apply to businessmen and since milken s actions by and large were legal at the time he did nothing wrong generally speaking they argue junk bonds were a brilliant innovation and even today occupy a large part of most investment portfolios there was a large market for junk bonds after savings and loan banks were deregulated milken was made into a scapegoat for the savings and loans scandal ambitious government officials such as rudy giuliani practically forced him to plead guilty although some supporters continue to maintain he was completely innocent on the other hand individuals who believe businessmen should adhere to higher moral standards such as financier warren buffett or former salomon brothers bond salesman michael lewis condemn many of milken s actions while they acknowledge his useful financial innovations they generally argue that junk bonds are a high risk investment risk averse investors should only allocate a portion of a well diversified portfolio to them milken artificially tampered with the economic laws of supply and demand when the demand for junk bonds exceeded the supply he created more fallen angels by promoting corporate raids that reduced the credit ratings of otherwise sound companies into junk status he improperly induced insurance companies to purchase his junk bonds in vast quantities and when the artificially inflated junk bond market collapsed this left policyholders including employees of many companies who had replaced their pension systems with annuities purchased from the corrupted insurance companies holding worthless paper he compensated himself out of proportion to his work while not the sole cause he nonetheless contributed to the collapse of america s savings corporate raids that often allowed smaller companies executives and financiers to acquire older and more established companies depending on ideology this was seen as a good thing or a bad thing while such practices arguably improved efficiency at these companies they also caused unemployment charitable and public relations work milken has used his personal fortune and high level contacts to become an influential voice in economics education and medical research business leaders including

discipline in frank herbert s dune universe following the butlerian jihad in the dune universe s back story it was forbidden to create man like machines thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of the human mind rayna butler as told to her by the spirit of saint serena thinking machines were outlawed throughout the universe and the mentat discipline was developed as a replacement mentats are humans trained to be able to mimic computers human minds developed to staggering heights of cognitive and analytical ability ironically the first mentat was selected by a thinking machine gilbertus albans selected from the corrin slave pens about one two zero b g by the independent robot erasmus displayed the first cognitive thinking and computer like calculation capacity necessary for a mentat unlike computers however mentats are not simply human calculators writ large instead the exceptional cognitive abilities of memory and perception are the foundations for supra logical hypothesizing mentats are able to sift large volumes of data and devise concise analyses in a process that goes far beyond logical deduction mentats cultivate the na ve mind the mind without preconception or prejudice that can extract the essential patterns or logic of data and deliver with varying degrees of certainty useful conclusions they are not limited to formulating syllogisms they are the supreme counselors of the dune universe filling roles as menial as archivists and clerks or as grand as advisor to the emperor the ability to be a mentat is a talent limited to a small number of people thus those with the discipline are prized in whatever role they choose there are also varying degrees of ability in dune thufir hawat is considered to be one of the best mentats known at the time a mentat s capabilities can be greatly increased by taking sapho juice but using it leads to addiction sapho is extracted from the root of the ecaz tree and its use doubles or even triples the mentat s immense processing power however repeated use turns the user s lips a shade of red being a mentat can be a profession in itself or the discipline can be added to other roles in dune paul atreides is a mentat duke later emperor in heretics of dune and chapterhouse dune miles teg is a mentat bashar or general who is the most formidable military commander in the known universe it s also possible to vary the discipline in dune the tleilaxu create twisted mentats for the baron vladimir harkonnen piter de vries being the most notable example the purpose of which is a sociopathic mentat free from the usual constraints of human morality or instinctual considerations de vries is among other things a sadist and acts as torturer for the baron in dune messiah duncan idaho is recreated as a ghola and trained as both a mentat and as a zensunni philosopher he then serves paul atreides as the house weapons master in children of dune he marries the regent alia but is then instrumental in protecting the royal heirs from her demonstrating that mentats are rarely simply disinterested observers and counselors in god emperor of dune leto outlaws the order and crushes any renegade training schools he finds unlike his father s execution of historians for the purpose of controlling his legacy and symbolism leto never explicitly mentions why he suppresses mentats leaving the reader to conclude that it simply plays a role in his larger purpose of oppressing humanity in order to create his golden path the art is not eliminated however surviving through underground schools notably the bene gesserit preserve the art assuming that leto knows of this through his prescience and approves the robot erasmus as well as the characters serena butler and reyna butler are inventions of brian herbert and not the original author of dune frank herbert gilbertus albans was the first mentat but the method by which he became one was never explained the mentat mantra the david lynch dune movie includes a scene in which piter de vries recites the following upon drinking sapho juice it is by will alone i set my mind in motion it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed the lips acquire stains the stains become a warning it is by will alone i set my mind in motion this mantra is a creation of lynch and does not appear in the books though in the first book there is mention that thufir hawat has cranberry stained lips due to sapho juice but because he is the only one about whom this remark is made it is quite possible that it was a personal habit of hawat to drink the sapho juice and not a general essential practice of mentats unofficially called the mentat mantra by fans it is often parodied to refer to real life substance addictions most notably caffeine correction all mentats drink sapho juice not just thufir hawat dune mayerling is a hunting lodge in lower austria where on january three zero one eight eight nine archduke crown prince rudolf of austria only son of emperor franz joseph and elisabeth and heir to the austro hungarian crown was found dead with his mistress baroness mary vetsera apparently as a result of suicide the suicide theory is not far fetched given the long line of outbreaks of mental instability in the habsburg dynasty caused by their long history of inbreeding rudolf s uncle the archduke viktor ludwig spent most of his life exiled on the island of capri following a series of scandals involving dressing up in women s clothes and molesting his military aides his mother elisabeth was cousin of mad king ludwig of bavaria conspiracy theories it was claimed by among others empress zita widow of the last emperor karl r one nine one six one nine one eight that the crown prince was killed either at the behest of austrian security officials for his suspected pro hungarian sympathies or by french agents he was close to georges clemenceau because he refused to participate in the deposition of his pro german father emperor franz josef no evidence has been discovered to prove either of these theories though an examination of the remains of marie vetsera which had been stolen in the early one nine nine zero s and on rediscovery were checked to ensure they were the correct remains contradicted the official reports that she had been shot her skull showed no evidence of bullet wounds or shrapnel instead the evidence was that she had been beaten to death a resulting re examination of files about the death of the crown prince revealed major discrepancies between the claimed manner of the deaths and the factual evidence including that rudolf had engaged in a violent struggle prior to his death that the gun that caused his death was not his and that six shots were fired from the gun how someone who had reportedly died instantly from the first shot managed to fire the remaining five bullets remains a mystery while the official statement of how the deaths occurred and its central theory of a double suicide is now discredited it remains unclear whether rudolf in fact battered his mistress to death before killing himself and if he did how he managed to shoot six bullets when the first would have instantly caused his death also open to suggestion is that both were killed by a third party no other source material is available to establish just what did happen empress zita who was the last surviving confidante of emperor franz

as keyboards see keyboard instrument the layout of a typical musical keyboard a musical keyboard is the set of adjacent depressible levers on a musical instrument which cause the instrument to produce sounds keyboards almost all share the common layout shown musical instruments with keyboards of this type include the piano harpsichord clavichord organ synthesizer or electric keyboard celesta accordion melodica glasschord and carillon since the most commonly encountered keyboard instrument is the piano the keyboard layout is often called the piano keyboard in spite of this keyboard instruments of different types are often played using different techniques in particular the electric keyboard uses pre set drum rhythms which respond to chords played in the left hand by the instrumentalist with other buttons and switches used to change rhythms and even the voice of the instrument in some european countries such a keyboard is called a hoxophone the twelve notes of the western musical scale are laid out with the lowest note on the left the larger keys for the seven natural notes of the c major scale c d e f g a b jut forward because these keys are often coloured white on a keyboard these are often called the white notes or white keys the keys for the remaining five notes which are not part of the c major scale namely c d d e f g g a a b are set back because these keys are often coloured black these notes are often called the black notes or black keys the pattern repeats at the interval of an octave the arrangement of longer keys for c major with intervening shorter keys for the intermediate semitones dates to the one five th century many keyboard instruments dating from before the nineteenth century have a keyboard with the colours of the keys reversed darker coloured keys for the white notes and white keys for the black notes a roland exr three keyboard the chromatic compass of keyboard instruments has tended to increase harpsichords

one keys per manual though some spinet models have four four or four nine an organ pedalboard a keyboard played by the organist s feet may vary in size from one two to three two notes piano keyboard which shows the alignment of the white and the black keys in a well designed keyboard the natural keys are of uniform width at the front and all keys are uniformly distributed if the width of an octave is taken to be one two units then the white key width is one two seven units and the centre of each of the twelve keys must be separated by one unit there have been variations in the design of the keyboard to address technical and musical issues for instance during the sixteenth century when instruments were often tuned in meantone temperament some harpsichords were constructed with the g and e keys split into two one portion of the g key operated a string tuned to g and the other operated a string tuned to a similarly one portion of the e key operated a string tuned to e the other portion operating a string tuned to d this extended the flexibility of the harpsichord enabling composers to write keyboard music calling for harmonies containing the so called wolf fifth e to g but without producing discomfort in the listeners other examples of variations in keyboard design include the janko keyboard and the chromatic keyboard systems on the accordion and bandone n other instruments share the keyboard layout although they are not keyboard instruments for example the xylophone marimba vibraphone and glockenspiel all have a separate sounding tone bar for each note and

process of tuning see tuning musical tuning is the system used to define which tones or pitches to use when playing music in other words it is the choice of number and spacing of frequency values which are used the tuning systems are usually defined in such a way that a listener perceives it as natural due to the psychoacoustic properties of tones various pitch combinations will sound more or less natural when used in combination for example a tone caused by a vibration twice the speed of another the ratio of one two forms the natural sounding octave another natural resonance found in musical scales the world over is the ratio of one three two three when octave reduced which is often called a perfect fifth more complex musical effects can be created through other relationships mathieu one nine nine seven building a tuning system is complicated when musicians want to make music with more than just a few differing tones as the number of tones is increased conflicts arise in how each tone combines with every other finding a successful combination of tunings has been the cause of debate and has lead to the creation of many different tuning systems across the world each tuning system has its own characteristics strengths and weaknesses subjects in general musical theory mathematics of musical scales other musical tunings chinese indian etc microtonal music psychoacoustics physics of music midi ways of tuning the twelve note chromatic scale it is impossible to tune the twelve note chromatic scale so that all intervals are perfect many different methods with their own various compromises have thus been put forward the main ones are just intonation in which the ratios of the frequencies between all notes are based on relatively low whole numbers such as three two five four or seven four or in which all pitches are based on the harmonic series music which are all whole number multiples of a single tone such a system may use two different ratios for what is the same interval in equal temperament depending on context for instance a major second may be either in the ratio nine eight or one zero nine for this reason just intonation may be less a suitable system for use on keyboard instruments or other instruments where the pitch of individual notes is not flexible on fretted instruments like guitars and lutes multiple frets for one interval is practical pythagorean tuning in which the ratios of the frequencies between all notes are all multiples of three two the pythagorean system was further developed by safi ad din al urmawi who divided the octave into seventeen parts limmas and commas and used in the turkish and persian tone systems meantone temperament a system of tuning which averages out pairs of ratios used for the same interval such as nine eight and one zero nine thus making it possible to tune keyboard instruments next to the twelve equal temperament which some would not regard as a form of meantone the best known form of this temperament is quarter comma meantone which tunes major thirds justly in the ratio of five four and divides them into two whole tones of equal size to do this eleven perfect fifths in each octave are flattened by a quarter of a syntonic comma with the remaining fifth being left very sharp such an unacceptably out of tune fifth is known as a wolf interval however the fifth may be flattened to a greater or lesser degree than this and the tuning system will retain the essential qualities of meantone temperament examples include the three one equal fifth and lucy tuning both just intonation and meantone temperament can be regarded as forms of regular temperament well temperament any one of a number of systems where the ratios between intervals are unequal but approximate to ratios used in just intonation unlike meantone temperament the amount of divergence from just ratios varies according to the exact notes being tuned so that c e will probably be tuned closer to a five four ratio than say db f because of this well temperaments have no wolf intervals a well temperament system is usually named after whoever first came up with it equal temperament a special case of well temperament in which adjacent notes of the scale are all separated by logarithmically equal distances one zero zero cents ogg format nine six nine kb since this scale divides an octave into twelve equal ratio steps the frequency ratio between adjacent notes is then the twelfth root of two two one one two or one zero five nine four six three zero nine tunings of other scale systems

emulate eastern tuning systems as well as western alpha and beta scales of wendy carlos quarter tone scale first presented by mikha il mishaqah used in the theory of arab music tone systems from this the heptatonic scales consisting of minor neutral and major seconds of maqamat are chosen this system was first promoted by al farabi using a two five tone scale stretched tuning makes an octave represent slightly more than a doubling in frequency it is usually applied to keyboard instruments with tines or thick strings where the ratio of harmonic to fundamental can be slightly greater than a true integer ratio typically piano and electric piano stretched tuning is sometimes claimed to give a warmer sound to chords comparisons and controversies between tunings all musical tuning have advantages and disadvantages twelve tone equal temperament is the standard and most usual tuning system used in western music today because it gives the advantage of modulation to any key without dramatically going out of tune as all keys are equally and slightly out of tune however just intonation provides the advantage of being entirely in tune with at least some and possible a great deal loss in ease of modulation referring to one two tet the composer terry riley who has written music for both tuning systems has been quoted as saying western music is fast because it s not in tune twelve tone equal temperament also currently has an advantage over just intonation in that most musicians will have instruments that can only play in equal temperament since these are readily available other tuning systems have other advantages and disadvantages and are chosen for these qualities it must be realized however that just as many people who play music today in equal temperament without having heard of it many musicians throughout the world and the past used just intonation without knowing it the octave or even other intervals such as the so called tritave or twelfth can advantageously be divided into a number of equal steps different from twelve popular choices for such an equal temperament include one nine two two three one five three and seven two parts to an octave each of these and the many other choices possible have their own distinct characteristics non equal and non just tunings also provide advantages for instance william sethares shows that the tunings of balinese gamelans are related to the inharmonic spectra or timbre of their metallophones and the harmonic spectra of stringed instruments such as the rebab just as just intonation and twelve tone equal temperament are related to the spectra or timbre of harmonic instruments alone some instruments such as the violin don t limit the musician to particular pitches allowing to choose the tuning system on the fly many performers on such instruments adjust the notes to be more in tune than the equal temperament system allows perhaps even without realizing it see also physics of

life the miller urey experiment or urey miller experiment was an experiment that simulated hypothetical conditions present on the early earth and tested for the occurrence of chemical evolution the oparin and haldane hypothesis stated that conditions on the primitive earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic precursors the miller urey tested this hypothesis the experiment is considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life it was conducted in one nine five three by stanley l miller and harold c urey at the university of chicago experiment and interpretation the experiment the experiment used water h two o methane ch four ammonia nh three and hydrogen h two the chemicals were all sealed inside a sterile array of glass tubes and flasks connected together in a loop with one flask half full of liquid water and another flask containing a pair of electrodes the liquid water was heated to induce evaporation sparks were fired through the atmosphere and water vapor to simulate lightning and then the atmosphere was cooled again so that the water could condense and trickle back into the first flask in a continuous cycle at the end of one week of continuous operation miller and urey observed that as much as one zero one five of the carbon within the system was now in the form of organic compounds two percent of the carbon had formed amino acids including one three of the two one that are used to make proteins in living cells with glycine as the most abundant however there are two forms of amino acids they are referred to as a left handed or a right handed amino acids only left handed amino acids are found in living organisms and the ones created in the miller urey experiment and all subsequent experiments succeed in creating right and left handed amino acids in roughly a five zero five zero ratio the molecules produced were simple organic molecules far from a complete living biochemical system but the experiment established that the hypothetical processes could produce some building blocks of life without requiring life to synthesize them first other experiments this experiment inspired many experiments in a similar vein in one nine six one joan or found that amino acids could be made from hydrogen cyanide hcn and ammonia in a water solution he also found that his experiment produced a large amount of the nucleotide base adenine experiments conducted later showed that the other rna and dna bases could be obtained through simulated prebiotic chemistry with a reducing atmosphere earth s early atmosphere there have been a number of objections to the implications derived from these experiments it is now believed that earth s original atmosphere did not contain as large a quantity of reducing molecules as was thought at the time originally it was thought that the primitive secondary atmosphere contained mostly nh three and ch four however it is likely that most of the atmospheric carbon was co two with perhaps some co and the nitrogen mostly n two the reasons for this are a volcanic gas has more co two co and n two than ch four and nh three and b uv radiation destroys nh three and ch four so that these molecules would have been short lived uv light photolyses h two o to h and oh radicals these then attack methane giving eventually co two and releasing h two which would be lost into space in practice gas mixtures containing co co two n two etc give much the same products as those containing ch four and nh three so long as there is no o two the h atoms come mostly from water vapor in fact in order to generate aromatic amino acids under primitive earth conditions it is necessary to use less hydrogen rich gaseous mixtures most of the natural amino acids hydroxyacids purines pyrimidines and sugars have been produced in variants of the miller experiment more recent results may have called this into question however simulations done at the university of waterloo and university of colorado in two zero zero five indicated that the early atmosphere of earth could have contained up to four zero hydrogen implying a much more hospitable environment for the formation of prebiotic organic molecules the escape of hydrogen from earth s atmosphere into space may have occurred at only one of the rate previously believed based on revised estimates of the upper atmosphere s temperature one of the authors prof owen toon notes in this new scenario organics can be produced efficiently in the early atmosphere leading us back to the organic rich soup in the ocean concept i

complement the waterloo colorado results in re establishing the importance of the miller urey experiment although lightning storms are thought to have been very common in the primordial atmosphere they are not thought to have been as common as the amount of electricity used by the miller urey experiment may imply these factors suggest that much lower concentrations of biochemicals would have been produced on earth than was originally predicted although the time scale would be one zero zero million years instead of a week similar experiments both with different sources of energy and with different mixtures of gases have resulted in amino and hydroxy acids being produced it is likely that at least some organic compounds would have been generated on the early earth however as soon as oxygen gas is added to the mixture no organic molecules are formed recent research has been seized upon by opponents of urey miller hypothesis which shows the presence of uranium in sediments dated to three seven ga and indicates it was transported in solution by oxygenated water otherwise it would have precipitated out rosing in fact most evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis was present during time periods from which there is evidence for a non oxygenic atmosphere conditions similar to those of the miller urey experiments are present in other regions of the solar system often substituting ultraviolet light for lightning as the driving force for chemical reactions on september two eight one nine six nine the murchison meteorite that fell near murchison victoria australia was found to contain over nine zero different amino acids nineteen of which are found in earth life comets and other icy outer solar system bodies are thought to contain large amounts of complex carbon compounds such as tholins formed by these processes in some cases so much so that the surfaces of these bodies are turned dark red or as black as asphalt the early earth was bombarded heavily by comets possibly providing a large supply of complex organic molecules along with the water and other volatiles they contributed this could also imply an origin of life outside of earth which then migrated here see panspermia recent related studies during recent years studies have been made of the amino acid composition of the products of old areas in old genes defined as those that are found to be common to organisms from several widely separated species assumed to share only the last universal ancestor lua of all extant species these studies found that the products of these areas are enriched in those amino acids that are also most readily produced in the miller urey experiment this suggests that the original genetic code was based on a smaller number of amino acids only those

zero zero years ago in persia where it was soon embedded with babylonian doctrines mithraism apparently originated in the eastern mediterranean around the first or second centuries bc it was practiced in the roman empire since the first century bc and reached its apogee around the third through fourth centuries ad when it was very popular among the roman soldiers mithraism disappeared from overt practice after the theodosian decree of ad three nine one banned all pagan rites and it apparently became extinct thereafter principles of mithraism romans encountered worship of the deity mithras as part of zoroastrianism in the eastern provinces of the empire particularly in asia minor now modern turkey mithraism is best documented in the form it had acquired in the later roman empire it was an initiatory mystery religion passed from initiate to initiate like the eleusinian mysteries it was not based on a supernaturally revealed body of scripture and hence very little written documentary evidence survives soldiers appeared to be the most plentiful followers of mithraism and women were apparently not allowed to join the mithraeum it is difficult for scholars to reconstruct the daily workings and beliefs of mithraism as the rituals were highly secret and limited to initiated men mithras was little more than a name until the massive documentation of franz cumont s texts and

also be identified by its separate entrance or vestibule its cave called the spelaeum or spelunca with raised benches along the side walls for the ritual meal and its sanctuary at the far end often in a recess before which the pedestal like altar stood many mithraea that follow this basic plan are scattered over much of the empire s former area particularly where the legions were stationed along the frontiers others may be recognized by their characteristic layout even though converted as crypts beneath christian churches in every mithraic temple the place of honor was occupied by a representation of mithras killing a sacred bull called a tauroctony it has been more recently proposed that the tauroctony is a symbolic representation of the constellations rather than an originally iranian animal sacrifice scene ulansey one nine nine one mithras is associated with perseus whose constellation is above that of the bull a serpent a scorpion a dog and a raven are present also thought to represent associated constellations from the structure of the mithraea it is possible to surmise that worshippers would have gathered for a common meal along the reclining couches lining the walls it is worth noting that most temples could hold only thirty or forty individuals the mithraeum itself was arranged so as to be an image of the universe members of the cult are thought to have moved about the mithraeum in imitation of the sun and constellations through the universe it is noticed by some researchers that this movement especially in the context of mithraic soterism seems to stem from the neoplatonic concept that the running of the sun from solstic to solstice is a parallel for the movement of the soul through the universe from pre existence into the body and then beyond the physical body into an afterlife also thought to take place in the mithraeum and revealed by the relief on a cup from mainz is the mithraic initiation in this act as depicted on the cup the initiate would be lead into a location where the cult s pater would be seated in the guise of mithras with a drawn bow accompanying the initiate is a mystagogue who explains the symbology and theology to the initiate the rite is thought to re enact what has come to be called the water miracle in which mithras fires a bolt into a rock and from the rock now spouts water beck r two zero zero zero

mithraeum were divided into seven ranks all members were apparently expected to progress through the first four ranks while only a few would go on to the three higher ranks the first four ranks seem to represent spiritual progress while the other three appear to have been specialized offices the seven ranks were corax raven nymphus bridegroom miles soldier leo lion perses persian heliodromus sun courier pater father the new initiate became a corax while the leo was an adept the titles of the first four ranks suggest the possibility that advancement through the ranks was based on introspection and spiritual growth the iconography of mithraism in the absence of any mithraist scripture all we know about mithras is what can be deduced from his images in the mithraea that have survived a statue of the tauroctony in the vatican museum note that mithras is looking toward the bull instead of away a stance rarely seen the tauroctony some depictions show mithras carrying a rock on his back much as atlas did and or wearing a cape that had the starry sky as its inside lining a bronze image of mithras emerging from an egg shaped zodiac ring found associated with a mithraeum along hadrian s wall now at the university of newcastle and an inscription from the city of rome suggest that mithras may have been seen as the orphic creator god phanes who emerged from the cosmic egg at the beginning of time bringing the universe into existence this view is reinforced by a bas relief at the estense museum in modena italy which shows phanes coming from an egg surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac in an image very similar to that at newcastle he is sometimes depicted as a man being born or reborn from a rock the petra genetrix typically with the snake oroboros wrapped around it it is commonly believed that the cave in mithraism imagery represents the cosmos and the rock is the cosmos seen from the outside hence the description of this god as rising from the dead according to some accounts mithras died was buried in a cavernous rock tomb and was resurrected another more widely accepted interpretation takes its clue from the writer porphyry who recorded that the cave pictured in the tauroctony was intended to be an image of the cosmos according to this view the cave depicted in that image may represent the great cave of the sky this interpretation was supported by research by k b stark in one eight six nine with astronomical support by roger beck one nine eight four and one nine eight eight david ulansey one nine eight nine and noel swerdlow one nine nine one this interpretation is reinforced by the constant presence in mithraic imagery of heavenly objects such as stars the moon and the sun and symbols for the signs of the zodiac one of the central motifs of mithraism is the tauroctony the myth of sacrifice by mithra of a sacred bull created by the supreme deity ahura mazda which mithra stabs to death in the cave having been instructed to do so by a crow sent from ahura mazda in this myth from the body of the dying bull spring plants animals and all the beneficial things of the earth it is thought that the bull represents the constellation of taurus however in the period we are considering the sun at the vernal equinox had left taurus two thousand years before and was in the process of moving from aries to pisces in light of this interpretation it has been suggested in recent times that the mithraic religion is somehow connected to the end of the astrological age of taurus and the beginning of the age of aries which took place about the year two zero zero zero bc it has even been speculated that the religion may have originated at that time although there is no record of it until the two nd century bc the identification of an age with a particular zodiac constellation is based on the sun s position during the vernal equinox before two zero zero zero bc the sun could have been seen against the stars of the constellation of taurus at the time of vernal equinox had there been an eclipse due to the precession of the equinoxes on average every two one six zero years the sun appears against the stars of a new constellation at vernal equinox the current astrological age started when the equinox precessed into the constellation of pisces in about the year one five zero bc with the age of aquarius starting in ad two six zero zero indeed the constellations common in the sky from about four zero zero zero bc to two zero zero zero bc were taurus the bull canis minor the dog hydra the snake corvus the raven and scorpio the scorpion all of which may be identified in the fresco from marino a standard hellenistic iconography illustration above right further support for this theory is the presence of a lion and a cup in some depictions of the tauroctony indeed leo a lion and aquarius the cup bearer were the constellations seen as the northernmost summer solstice and southernmost winter solstice positions in the sky during the age of taurus the precession of the equinoxes was discovered or at least publicized by the greek astronomer hipparchus in the two nd century bc whether the phenomenon was known by mithraists previously is unknown in any case mithras was presumed to be very powerful if he was able to rotate the heavens and thus kill the bull or displacing taurus as the reigning image in the heavens some commentators surmise that the mithraists worshipped mithras as the mediator between man and the supreme god of the upper and nether world other commentators inspired by james frazer s theories have additionally labeled mithras a mystery religion with a life death rebirth deity comparable to isis the resurrected jesus or the persephone demeter cult of the eleusinian mysteries history of mithraism mithraism in persia iran relief from taq i bostan iran showing ardashir ii of sassanid empire at the center receiving his crown from ahura mazda the two stand on a prostrate enemy at the left is mithra depicted as a priest wearing a crown of sun rays holding a priest s barsam and standing on a sacred lotus mithraism is generally considered to be of persian origins specifically an outgrowth of zoroastrian culture though not of zoroaster s teachings for zoroaster was a monotheist for whom ahuramazda was the one god darius the great was equally stringent in the official monotheism of his reign no god but ahuramazda is ever mentioned in any of the numerous inscriptions that survive of his reign five two one four eight five bc however the official cult is rarely the sole religion in an area the following inscription from susa of artaxerxes ii mnemon four zero four three five eight bc demonstrates that not all the achaemenid kings were as purely zoroastrian as darius the great artaxerxes the great king says by the favor of ahuramazda anahita and mithra this palace i built may ahuramazda anahita and mithra protect me from all evil and that which i have built may they not shatter nor harm it is tempting to identify the roman mithras with the persian mithra except that there is no known persian legend or text about mithra killing a bull or being associated with other animals on the other hand there is a story of ahriman the evil god in popular developments of zoroastrianism killing a bull it is easy to explain the sun god mithra being worshipped in the windowless cave like mithraeum each night the sun was thought to journey through the underworld after sunset from west to east until sunrise a possible link between persia and rome which could be the stage for these changes may be the kingdoms of parthia and pontus in asia minor several of their kings were called mithradates meaning given by mithra starting with mithradates i of parthia died one three eight bc it would seem that in those kingdoms mithra was a god whose power lent luster even to a king and it was at pergamum in the two nd century bc that greek sculptors started to produce bas relief imagery of mithra taurocthonos mithra the bull slayer although the cult of mithras never caught on in the greek homeland those sculptures may indicate the route between persian mithra and roman mithras around the first century ad the greek historian plutarch wrote about pirates of cilicia who practiced the mithraic secret rites around six seven bc since cilicia was the coastal province in the southeast of anatolia the mithras mentioned by plutarch may have been worship of the persian god mithra or may have been associated with ahriman the persian god who killed a bull mithraism in early rome double faced mithraic relief rome two nd three rd century ce louvre museum front mithra killing the bull being looked over by the sun god and the moon god back mithra banquetting with the sun god to celebrate his victory over the dark forces of the universe mithraism arrived fully mature at rome with the return of the legions from the east in the first century bc as an action god of armies and the champion of heroes he appealed to the professional roman soldiers who carried his cult to iberia britain the german frontiers and dacia the cult of mithras began to attract attention at rome about the end of the first century ad perhaps in connection with the conquest of then zoroastrian armenia the earliest material evidence for the roman worship of mithras dates from that period in a record of roman soldiers who came from the military garrison at carnuntum in the roman province of upper pannonia near the danube river in modern austria near the hungarian border these soldiers fought against the parthians and were involved in the suppression of the revolts in jerusalem from six zero a d to about seven zero a d when they returned home they made mithraic dedications probably in the year seven one or seven two statius mentions the typical mithraic relief in his thebaid book i seven one nine seven two zero around a d eight zero plutarch s life of pompey also makes it clear that the worship of mithras was well known at that time by a d two zero zero mithraism had spread widely through the army and also among traders and slaves the german frontiers have yielded most of the archaeological evidence of its prosperity small cult objects connected with mithra turn up in archaeological digs from romania to hadrian s wall mithraism in the roman empire sol invictus on the reverse of this coin by usurper victorinus at rome the third century emperors encouraged mithraism because of the support which it afforded to the divine nature of monarchs mithras thus became the giver of authority and victory to the imperial house from the time of commodus who participated in its mysteries its supporters were to be found in all classes concentrations of mithraic temples are found on the outskirts of the roman empire along hadrian s wall in northern england three mithraea have been identified at housesteads carrawburgh and rudchester the discoveries are in the university of newcastle s museum of antiquities where a mithraeum has been recreated recent excavations in london have uncovered the remains of a mithraic temple near to the center of the once walled roman settlement on the bank of the walbrook stream mithraea have also been found along the danube and rhine river frontier in the province of dacia where in two zero zero three a temple was found in alba iulia and as far afield as numidia in north africa as would be expected mithraic ruins are also found in the port city of ostia and in rome the capital where as many as seven hundred mithraea may have existed a dozen have been identified its importance at rome may be judged from the abundance of monumental remains more than seven five pieces of sculpture one zero zero mithraic inscriptions and ruins of temples and shrines in all parts of the city and its suburbs a well preserved late two nd century mithraeum with its altar and built in stone benches originally built beneath a roman house as was a common practice survives in the crypt over which has been built the basilica of san clemente rome the demise of mithraism worship of the sun sol did exist within the indigenous roman pantheon as a minor part and always as a pairing with the moon however in the east there were many solar deities including the greek helios who was largely displaced by apollo by the three rd century the popular cults of apollo and mithras had started to merge into the syncretic cult known as sol invictus and in two seven four ce the emperor aurelian whose mother had been a priestess of the sun made worship of sol invictus official subsequently aurelian built a splendid new temple in rome and created a new body of priests to support it pontifex solis invicti attributing his victories in the east to sol invictus but none of this affected the existing cult of mithras which remained a non official cult some senators held positions in both cults however this period was also the beginning of the decline of mithraism as dacia was lost to the empire and invasions of the northern peoples resulted in the destruction of temples along a great stretch of frontier the main stronghold of the cult the spread of christianity through the empire boosted by constantine s tolerance of it from around three one zero ce also took its toll particularly as christianity admitted women while mithraism did not which obviously limited its potential for rapid growth the reign of julian who attempted to restore the faith and suppress christianity and the usurpation of eugenius renewed the hopes of its devotees but the decree secured by theodosius in three nine four totally forbidding non christian worship may be considered the end of mithraism s formal public existence mithraism still survived in certain cantons of the alps into the five th century and clung to life with more tenacity in its eastern homelands its eventual successor as the carrier of persian religion to the west was manichaeism which competed strenuously with christianity for the status of world religion connections there is much speculation that christian beliefs were influenced by mithraic belief ernest renan in the origins of christianity promoted the idea that mithraism was the prime competitor to christianity in the second through the fourth century ad although some scholars feel the written claims that the emperors nero commodus septimius severus caracalla and the tetrarchs were initiates are dubious as there is little evidence that mithraic worship was accorded official status as a roman cult other than its official form as sol invictus the first universal religion of the greco roman world bull and cave themes are found in christian shrines dedicated to the archangel michael who after the legalization of christianity became the patron saint of soldiers many of those shrines were converted mithraea for instance the sacred cavern at monte gargano in apulia refounded in four nine three it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the mithras cult was transferred to the previously unvenerated archangel bull and crypt are linked in the catholic saint saturnin frequently sernin or saturninus of toulouse france the mithraeum is retained as a crypt under his earliest church evocatively named notre dame du taur it has also been speculated that the ancient orobouros of mithraism the encircling serpent about to bite its own tail was adapted for a christian symbol of the limited confines of time and space the snake around a rock also is reminscent of the midgard serpent j rmungandr who was said to surround midgard the earth according to norse traditions christians would argue that because the gospels are thought to have been mostly before one zero zero and that since very little is known of roman mithraism until after one zero zero that it is implausible to say that christianity borrowed its doctrines from mithraism some christians have suggested that mithraism may have in fact borrowed elements from christianity other non christian scholars disagree with the conclusions a better determinant of borrowing is to compare core doctrines between christianity and mithraism the adoption of imagery or icons or festivals is fairly peripheral such as the adoption by christendom of winter solstice or saturnalia festivals as christmas but seldom reflects basic religious tenets a further example of this is the various gnostic cults such as pelagianism which adopted the personage of jesus or the concept of a savior yet did not adopt the underlying doctrinal elements similarities to christianity according to martin a larson in the story of christian origins one nine seven seven mithraism and christianity derived from the same sources originally from the savior cult of osiris a rarely discussed view among mithraic and christian scholars but which accounts for the similarities without assuming a christian deriviation from mithraism he also believes that the essenes were jewish pythagoreans whose members not only gave birth to christianity as essenes but were directly influenced by zoroastrian doctrine as pythagoreans mithraism an established but exclusive sect devoted to social justice was assimilated by state sponsored christianity before being disposed of in name the resemblances between the two churches were so striking as to impress even the minds of antiquity cumont one nine three like origen an early christian apologist mithraism held that all souls pre existed in the ethereal regions with god and inhabited a body upon birth similar to pythagorean essene and pauline theology life then becomes the great struggle between good and evil spirit and body ending in judgment with the elect being saved they both admitted to the existence of a heaven inhabited by beautiful ones and a hell peopled by demons situate in the bowels of earth cumont one nine one both religions purified themselves through baptism and each participated in an outwardly similar type of sacrament bread and wine both the birth of mithra and the birth of christ have been celebrated on december two five th although nowhere does the bible claim that christ was born on this day both mithra and christ were supposedly visited by shepherds and magi both mithraism and christianity considered sunday their holy day many have noted that the title of pope father is found in mithraic doctrine and seemingly prohibited in christian doctrine the words peter rock and mass sacrament have original significance in mithraism mithraism and early christianity considered abstinence celibacy and self control to be among their highest virtues both had similar beliefs about the world destiny heaven and hell and the immortality of the soul their conceptions of the battles between good and evil were almost identical including a great and final battle at the end of times christianity adopted the millennial epochs that were integral to mithraism from zoroastrianism mithraism s flood at the beginning of history was deemed necessary because what began in water would end in fire according to mithraic eschatology both religions believed in revelation as key to their doctrine as do most religions both awaited the last judgment and resurrection of the dead christ and mithra were both referred to directly as the logos larson one eight four when inducted into the degree of leo he was purified with honey and baptised not with water but with fire as john the baptist declared that his successor would baptise after this second baptism initiates were considered participants and they received the sacrament of bread and wine commemorating mithra s banquet at the conclusion of his labors larson one nine zero although the cult of mithra rivaled christianity in rome they were among different social classes mithra was popular among soldiers and nobles after four centuries of growth mithraism had a disadvantage to christian populism by barring women and emphasizing the elitist nature of the belief under emperors like julian and commodus mithra became the patron of roman armies cumont eight seven christians referred to themselves as soldiers of christ they venerated jesus in mithraic sun god fashion calling him light of the world or son sun of righteousness christians also claimed their savior s death was marked by a solar eclipse sunday became the primary day of worship for christians despite observing the jewish sabbath for centuries mithra s birthday was adopted by christians in the four th century a d as the birth of christ j smith one four

easter when the sun rises toward its apogee mithra performed miracles of raising the dead healing the sick making the blind see the lame walk and casting out devils as a peter son of the petra rock he carried the keys to the kingdom of heaven as st peter is said to have the keys to the gates of heaven h smith one two nine before returning to heaven mithra had his last supper with his twelve

line with a similar acronym suv history minivans were launched to the market almost simultaneously by by chrysler dodge caravan in late one nine eight three and by renault renault espace in one nine eight four though these two cars were developed almost entirely separately they can each trace their roots back to the same point the minivan design was originally conceived in the late one nine seven zero s by chrysler uk in partnership with the french manufacturer matra who were also affiliated with simca the former french subsidiary of the chrysler corporation who were sold in one nine seven seven to the psa group peugeot citro n the chrysler uk matra design was originally intended to be sold as a talbot and to be a replacement for the talbot matra simca rancho station wagon early prototypes were designed to use simca parts and hence featured a grille reminiscent of the simca one three zero seven however after acquiring all of chrysler s european assets psa decided the design was too expensive and risky to put into production and matra took their idea to renault who agreed psa finally ventured into the minivan sector one one years later with the citro n evasion peugeot eight zero six the matra concept became the renault espace however chrysler under whom matra had originally conceived the espace had also been developing the minivan concept themselves and managed to release their own dodge caravan a year earlier than the espace in one nine eight three the term minivan derived from the fact that cars such as the dodge caravan were considerably smaller than traditional north american passenger vans such as the ford e series the target market for the minivan was families living in suburban areas this vehicle was a cross between the station wagon and the large work vans that people would customize for passenger travel in north america it came at a time when families wanted a different vehicle that didn t have the stigma of the station wagon era of their parents and also wanted better fuel economy than that of the previously popular v eight powered station wagons vans the minivan also offered another change from the large van or the station wagon front wheel drive usually found only on smaller automobiles this made for easier assembly of the vehicle and allowed for more cargo passenger area along the floor with the absence of the drive shaft hump minivans typically have removable seats and with the seats removed the cargo area in the larger minivans can hold a four x eight sheet of drywall or plywood flat in the usa in order for the style of minivan to circumvent the one nine eight zero s emission standards the minivan had to be classified as a truck and could not have four doors like a car early us minivans such as the dodge caravan were three door configurations with a sliding curbside door early minivans came with four cylinder motors which although they were more efficient were not able to meet the life span of bigger engines it was common to require major engine repairs on the four cylinder motors the vehicles were also extremely sluggish when these small engines were paired with hydraulic automatic transmissions later six cylinder motors were offered and have become a standard choice by purchasers who plan to operate the vehicle for many years minivans are also notorious for having problems with their transaxles current models two zero zero six full size mazda mpv left and compact mazda five right minivans modern minivans are now very similar to station wagons except they have a higher profile also their hood is shorter as they have more vertical room current models have two sliding doors or normal doors if they are compact minivans all minivans sold in north america have sliding doors with the exception of the first generation mazda mpv honda odyssey and isuzu oasis today many minivan manufacturers including ford gm and daimlerchrysler also offer their minivans as cargo vans rather than passenger vans these cargo vans are usually available only through fleet sales buick gl eight sold in china the trend for compact minivans or mini mpvs began in europe in the late one nine nine zero s with the launch of the renault sc nic compact minivans were usually cars with minivan bodies but based on the chassis and engines of a compact car in the case of the sc nic the renault m gane the runaway success of the sc nic saw the car spawn a multitude of imitators including the general motors zafira the citro n xsara picasso the volkswagen touran and the nissan almera tino by the mid two zero zero zero s virtually all mainstream automakers in europe had a mini mpv in their range also in the mid two zero zero zero s manufacturers began to use minivan style designs on even smaller chassis in cars such as the opel meriva based on the corsa supermini such models enjoyed some popularity in the united states in the late one nine eight zero s and early one nine nine zero s for example the mitsubishi expo mitsubishi chariot in other markets and nissan access for two zero zero six the lone compact minivan available in the united states is the mazda five in the asean nations

toyota qualis replaced by the toyota innova etc public image in the usa a stack of hot wheels toy dodge caravans minivans have a mixed image they have a reputation for poor maneuverability and performance in comparison with other types of vehicles however they are also the vehicle of choice for large suburban families and are frequently associated with soccer moms perhaps because of these associations minivan are often seen as dowdy or boring many buyers who need a car with a large amount of luggage and passenger space prefer the rugged go anywhere image of suvs or the sporty upscale

throws her tam o shanter cap up in the air in a freeze frame at the end of the montage fans have noted that the statue takes a couple of liberties with that opening scene for both practical and artistic reasons one is that where mary actually tossed the cap was in the crosswalk in the middle of the street clearly not the best location for a statue the other is that the actual release point of the cap was around her waist whereas the statue has her hand high overhead barely touching the cap as if she were catching it instead of tossing it mary tyler moore is referenced in the hit song

duly elected body its efflorescence into universal house of justice messages to the bah world p seven eight shoghi effendi announced remey s appointment as the president of the international bah council ibc in a cablegram dated march two one nine five one at the end of the year december two four one nine five one shoghi effendi appointed remey to be among the first contingent of the hands of the cause of god aftermath of shoghi effendi s passing when shoghi effendi passed away in one nine five seven the hands of the cause met in a private conclave at bahj in haifa and determined that he hadn t appointed a successor they decided that since such a situation wasn t provided for in any explicit text where a guardian doesn t appoint a succesor that it would need to be reviewed and ejudicated upon by the universal house of justice which hadn t been elected yet remey signed a unnanimous declaration of the hands that shoghi effendi had died without having appointed his successor remey had always insisted on the importance of finding a guardian and held the fundamental belief that there must and will always be a guardian common belief amongst the other hands of the cause was that this could not happen as the guardian must be aghsan a term used to describe male descendants of bah u ll h of which there were none remaining in one nine six zero remey himself proclaimed to be the guardians on the grounds that he was appointed by virtue of being the president of the first international bah council the embyronic universal house of justice and only a guardian can lead the house the original persian cablegram notifiying that he would be president used the term ra is meaning in both arabic and farsi president or head of the ibc ra is is the same term used by abdu l bah in his will and testament in the passage referring to the guardian as the sacred head and distinguished member of the universal house of justice he claimed to have been adopted by abdu l bah in a private meeting and being called my son was a public recognition thereby making him an adopted descendant of bah u ll h or aghsan given that he did not renounce his attempt the hands of the cause and remey formed a schism in the religion each excommunicating the other as covenant breakers remey continued the teachings of bah u ll h under the title orthodox bah s under the hereditary guardian although remey was initially unsuccessful to garner more than a hundred supporters the french national spiritual assembly led by joel bray marangella formed a narrow majority to support remey and was dispanded marangella was one of remey s staunchest supporters for a few years before claiming to be the third guardian after remey had appointed him second guardian successorship from before one nine six nine through remey s death in one nine seven four and beyond there was a dispute over successsion that divided remey s followers into several divisions only three remain as the others appear to be defunct joel bray marangella after his proclamation in one nine six zero remey went on to form the second international bah council and appointed joel bray marangella to be its president in one nine six two remey gave marangella a sealed envelope with instructions to open it when the time was right in one nine six five mason remey called for the council to become active and marangella opened the sealed letter which was a hand written note by mason appointing marangella as his successor shortly afterward remey deactivated the council once marangella shared this appointment in one nine six nine he attracted his own following around himself while remey was still alive called the orthodox bah faith donald harvey in one nine six seven remey publically declared that he was choosing donald harvey to be his successor whilst just two years later marangella made his proclamation to being the third guardian asserting that when remey activated the second international bah council he ceased being the guardian at that moment since he claimed there could only be one guardian alive at a time remey never commented on the matter further than stating that according to the will and testament of abdu l bah the guardian is the guardian for life he never denounced maragella for his actions despite being openly attacked by him and publicly ridiculed those who followed donald harvey accepted his appointed successor jacques shogomonian who now claims to be the fourth guardian of the bah faith under the group called bah s loyal to the fourth guardian pepe remey in florence italy one nine six four remey adopted as his son an italian bah named joseph pepe who he had known since the one nine five zero s pepe served as remey s personal secretary until remey s death in one nine seven four in his will remey left pepe all things tangible and intangible which some believe included the guardianship although pepe never went about collecting believers around himself he was proactive in publicising details about his adopted father s life dr leland jensen a supporter of remey put forward pepe as the third guardian since neither of mason s other two appointees were sons or aghsan he pointed to the provision in the will and testament of abdu l bah that states the successor must be a first born son or an aghsan page one four being remey s son and being appointed jensen claimed made the other non hereditary appointments irrelevent especially due to the fact that mason referred to his own guardianship as the hereditary guardianship pepe never accepted being the leader of jensen s bah s under the provisions of the covenant bupc letters written by pepe remey to individual believers contradict each other stating in some that he was never a bah nor the guardian and in others that he had been a bah since the early five zero s when he met mason and that he was of course mason s successor one of jensen s followers neal chase claims to have been adopted and appointed privately by

and music where the work is stripped down to its most fundamental features in other fields of art it has been used to describe the novels of ernest hemingway the plays of samuel beckett the films of robert bresson the stories of raymond carver called the king of minimalism and even the automobile designs of colin chapman as a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post world war ii western art most strongly with the visual arts for example the paintings of mark rothko the term has expanded to encompass a movement in music which features repetition and iteration for example the music of steve reich philip glass and terry riley see also post minimalism it is rooted in the spare aspects of modernism and is often associated with postmodernism and reaction against expressionism in both painting and composition the term minimalist can also refer to anything which is spare stripped to its essentials or providing only the outline of structure independent of the particular art movement and minimalism the tendency to reduce to fundamentals it is sometimes applied to groups or individuals practicing asceticism and the reduction of physical possessions and needs to a minimum minimalism in visual art one of dan flavin s lighting tube installations stack by donald judd a minimalist painting for example will typically use a limited number of colors and have a simple geometric design minimalist sculpture on the other hand is greatly focused on the materials see david smith and donald judd while many believe minimalism to be a movement specific to geometric representations it extends far outside this constraint there were three notable phases of the minimalist movement first the distillation of the forms wherein the greatest contributors were probably the russian constructivists and the romanian sculptor constantin br ncu i the russian constructivists proclaiming the distillation was in order to create a universal language of art which the masses were meant to understand it may have also supported the rapid industrialization planned for the massive country br ncu i s work was much more of a search for the purity of the form and thus paved the way for the abstractions that were to come such as minimalism the second and most notable phase in the movement came with artists including carl andre anne truitt dan flavin sol lewitt frank stella donald judd ad reinhardt and robert smithson it commenced in one nine six four with the exhibition of dan flavin s monument for v tatlin which was an assembly of neon lighting tubes the tubes had not been modified in any way by the artist merely arranged the assembly did not signify anything other than itself it simply existed these one nine six zero s artists were anti romantic they very explicitly stated that their art was not self expression in complete opposition to the previous decade s abstract expressionists very soon they created a minimal style whose features included rectangular and cubic forms purged of all metaphor equality of parts repetition neutral surfaces industrial materials all of which leads to immediate visual impact later minimal sculptors included tony smith larry bell and john mccracken ad reinhardt summed up the style in these terms the more stuff in it the busier the work of art the worse it is more is less less is more the eye is a menace to clear sight the laying bare of oneself is obscene art begins with the getting rid of nature this style was heavily criticised it was called futile mechanistic mandarin elitist circular pedantic and authoritarian some critics thought they were dealing with outright fraud also notable are the post minimalists including martin puryear tyrone mirchell melvin edwards and joel shapiro the keystone of post minimalism is the often distinct references to objects without direct representation this has become a predominant trend in modern sculpture musical minimalism main article minimalist music the cover of the beatles so called white album in classical music of the last three five years the term minimalism is sometimes applied to music which displays some or all of the following features repetition often of short musical phrases with minimal variations over long periods of time or stasis often in the form of drones and long tones emphasis on consonant harmony a steady pulse minimalist music is sometimes very similar currently to electronic music and composition it should be noted that the minimalist movement in music bears only an occasional relationship to the movement of the same name in visual art this connection is probably one reason why many minimalist composers dislike the term philip glass whose group initially performed at art galleries where his minimalist visual artist friends were showing reportedly said of minimalism that word should be stamped out also the so called white album from the beatles released in one nine six eight can be seen as an part of minimalism in music the songs were very simple just guitar bass and drums but also the cover of the album plain white and in the beginning even without words can be seen as an piece of minimalism many people think this was a reaction to the vibe of the year one nine six seven the album came after the very colorful sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band with all it s little sounds and tricks minimalist design the term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in design and architecture wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements architect ludwig mies van der rohe adopted the motto to describe his aesthetic tactics of flattening and emphasizing the building s frame eliminating interior walls and adopting an open plan and reducing the structure to a strong transparent elegant skin designer buckminster fuller adopted a similar saying doing more with less but his concerns were more oriented towards technology and engineering than aesthetics contemporary architects working in this tradition include john pawson eduardo souto de moura tadao ando and peter zumthor literary minimalism literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words minimalist authors eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning readers are expected to take an active role in the creation of a story to choose sides based on oblique hints and innuendo rather than reacting to directions from the author the characters in minimalist stories and novels tend to be unexceptional they re average people who sell pool supplies or coach second tier athletic teams not famous detectives or the fabulously wealthy generally the short stories are slice of life stories some one nine four zero s era crime fiction of writers such as james m cain and jim thompson adopted a stripped down matter of fact prose style to considerable effect this prose style may be classified as minimalism another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the meta fiction trend of the one nine six zero s and early one nine seven zero s john barth coover and william h gass these writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter minimalist authors include the following raymond carver chuck palahniuk bret easton ellis amy hempel bobbie ann mason tobias wolff grace paley sandra cisneros mary robison and frederick barthelme the irish author samuel beckett is also known for writing minimalistic plays and short stories minimalism in philosophy minimalism in philosophy or minimalistic philosophies indicates a philosophy formed around only a few elements of life as opposed to the full spectrum people practicing minimalistic philosophies often resort to living life with the bare minimum of what is required to survive cults often claim to practice minimalistic philosophies where the leaders exhort their followers to abandon things of value in their lives including things as basic as clothes and the right to maintain personal hygiene most modern philosophies could also be considered minimalistic in that they resort to providing only a limited set of valued elements as opposed to everything a person needs to live their life for example a philosophy centered around only money minimalism postmodern art a magneto provides pulses of electrical power to the spark plugs in some petrol powered internal combustion engines where batteries are not available most commonly those in two stroke and four stroke engines used in small motorcycles lawnmowers and chainsaws as well as in most small aircraft and some racing automobiles serving a similar function to the coil type ignition system found in automobiles in aircraft typically each cylinder has two spark plugs each driven from a separate magneto this arrangement provides redundancy in the event of a failure of one of the magnetos and two sparks burn more efficiently than one magnetos combine the functions of a dynamo contact breaker points and coil into one unit the engine turns a permanent magnet inside a coil of wire to provide a basic source of electrical energy on each revolution a cam opens the contact breaker one or more times interrupting the current causing the voltage in the secondary winding of the coil to reach a very high value enough to arc across the electrodes of the spark plug because no battery or other source of energy is required the magneto is a rugged reliable and self contained solution to providing ignition of the fuel in some modern magneto designs an electronic switch replaces the contact breaker see

was a roman emperor two three five two three eight he was conspicuous as the first barbarian who wore the imperial purple and the first never to set foot in rome he was the first of the so called soldier emperors of the three rd century but certainly not the last his rule is often considered to mark the beginning of the crisis of the third century maximinus was born in thrace or moesia to a gothic father and an alanic mother he was reportedly eight feet six inches two five nine m tall and of tremendous strength he joined the army during the reign of septimius severus but did not rise to a powerful position until promoted by alexander severus maximinus was in command of the recruits from pannonia who were angered by alexander s payments to the alemanni and his avoidance of war the troops among which legio xxii primigenia elected the stern maximinus killing young alexander and his mother at moguntiacum mainz in two three five the praetorian guard acclaimed him emperor and their choice was grudgingly confirmed by the senate who were displeased to have a peasant as emperor maximinus hated the nobility and was ruthless towards those he suspected of plotting against him he began by eliminating the close advisors of alexander his suspicions may have been justified two plots against maximinus were foiled the first was during a campaign across the rhine during which a group of officers supported by influential senators plotted the destruction of a bridge across the river to leave maximinus stranded on the other side afterwards they planned to elect senator magnus emperor however the plot was discovered and the conspirators executed the second plot involved mesopotamian archers who were loyal to alexander they planned to elevate quartinus but their leader macedo

mst three k is a cult television comedy series created by joel hodgson featuring a man and his robot sidekicks who are trapped on a satellite in space and forced to watch particularly bad movies series creator hodgson originally played the stranded man joel robinson when he left in one nine nine three series head writer michael j nelson replaced him as new b movie victim mike nelson and continued in the role for the rest of the show s run the format proved to be influential during its eleven years and one nine eight episodes including one feature film mst three k attained a fiercely loyal fan base and much critical acclaim the series also garnered a peabody award in one nine nine three premise two mad scientists dr clayton forrester played by trace beaulieu and his sidekick dr laurence erhardt played by josh weinstein launch joel robinson hodgson a janitor working for the gizmonics institute into space and force him to watch truly horrible b movies they do this in order to measure how much bad movie making it takes to drive a person crazy and to pinpoint the perfect b movie to use as a weapon in dr forrester s scheme of world domination the tv s frank played by frank conniff replaced dr erhardt in the second season premiere following weinstein s departure from the series gypsy trapped on board the satellite of love s o l a reference to a lou reed song joel builds the robots that populate the ship ostensibly because he is lonely and as an homage to the one nine seven zero s film silent running the robots are tom servo voiced first by weinstein then by kevin murphy and crow t robot voiced first by beaulieu then by bill corbett who accompany joel in the screening room gypsy voiced first by weinstein inhaling as he spoke then by jim mallon and later by patrick brantseg both using a falsetto voice who does not appear in every episode but handles the higher functions of the s o l such as steering the ship and cambot the recorder of the experiments who is never visible but occasionally interacts with the others also making intermittent appearances in the show s early years is magic voice a disembodied female voice whose primary role is to announce the start of the first commercial break in each episode joel has no control over when the movies start for as the theme song states he used those special parts to make his robot friends as the movies play the silhouettes of joel tom and crow are visible at the bottom of the screen wisecracking and mocking the movie a practice they often referred to as riffing to prevent being driven mad just before or after commercial breaks joel and later mike and the bots sometimes perform skits songs or other short sketch pieces called host segments that are often related to the movie they are watching these segments sometimes even feature visits by prominent characters from the movie such as torgo from manos the hands of fate but before too much frivolity can transpire the movie sign lights flash signaling the resumption of the movie many episodes also include screenings of unintentionally hilarious short films or shorts including propaganda style films from the one nine five zero s such as a training film for chevrolet sales managers and films intended to teach children about posture or personal hygiene these are less frequent in later episodes history the satellite of love mystery science theater three zero zero zero first aired on local tv in the twin cities on ktma tv a uhf station not a cable access channel as is sometimes reported from november two four one nine eight eight to may one nine eight nine the station s declining fortunes forced it to cancel mst three k but just as its run was ending the creators used a short best of reel to pitch the concept to executives at the comedy channel a national cable channel that was then being created it became one of the first two shows picked up by it after one season there comedy channel and rival comedy cable network ha merged to become comedy central it would run there for six more seasons reigning as its signature series for several years before falling out of favor with the network s management when comedy central dropped the show after a shorter than normal seventh season mst three k s internet fan base staged a precedent setting write in campaign to keep the show alive this included taking contributions from mst three k fans worldwide for a full page ad in the television trade publication daily variety magazine one notable contributor to the campaign was tv personality and biography host jack perkins who had been parodied on the series several times this effort led the sci fi channel to pick up the series where it resumed with some cast changes and ran for three more seasons the series finale premiered on august eight one nine nine nine although an episode produced earlier in the season was the last new episode of mst three k broadcast on september one two one nine nine nine reruns continued on the sci fi channel until january three one two zero zero four in total there were one nine eight full episodes of mst three k the show s run coincided with the growth of the internet and numerous fans msties devoted websites to the series the internet also facilitated tape trading of previous episodes among fans a practice the show s creators encouraged by flashing the phrase keep circulating the tapes during the closing credits of episodes every episode during seasons two three and four before season five started lawyers alerted them that the phrase may constitute a support of piracy there were two official fan conventions in minneapolis run by the series production company itself zanily called conventiocon expofest a rama one nine nine four and conventiocon expofest a rama two electric bugaloo one nine nine six respectively the second being a misspelled reference to the movie breakin two electric boogaloo some noted celebrity fans of mst three k are film director and producer steven spielberg writer director paul schrader former vice president al gore time film critic richard corliss singer songwriter weird al yankovic and msnbc anchor keith olbermann cambot as he appeared in the early years of the series when joel hodgson decided to leave the series halfway through season five an episode was written in which his character escaped from the s o l after being forced to sit through the joe don baker movie mitchell joel escaped with the help of gypsy and mike nelson a hired by doctor forrester to help to prepare for an audit from the fraternal order of mad science after they discovered an escape pod named the deus ex machina in a box marked hamdingers to replace joel dr forrester sent mike up in his place the series head writer michael j nelson played mike from one nine nine three until the end of the series debates sometimes heated raged in fan forums about who was the better host for quite some time but in more recent years a consensus has developed among the fanbase that acknowledges that each performer had his merits a feature film in which mike and the bots worked over this island earth was released in one nine nine six during the gap in the show s run between seasons six and seven which explains the absence of both tv s frank and pearl forrester unfortunately universal studios invested few resources into the resultant mystery science theater three zero zero zero the movie the film was never given wide release instead playing for a limited time in different cities and then moving to another city the result was that many fans did not even know it had been released the widowmaker pearl forrester used during the eight th season before the series moved to the sci fi channel trace beaulieu who played dr forrester and crow departed the series in his place was mary jo pehl as dr forrester s mother pearl her sidekicks were the idiotic planet of the apes inspired professor bobo played by murphy and the highly evolved omniscient yet equally idiotic observer aka brain guy played by writer bill corbett corbett also competently took over crow s voice and puppetry in the middle of the first season on the sci fi channel the eighth national season overall mallon handed over the voice and puppetry work for gypsy to bbi staffer patrick brantseg at first sci fi channel officials mandated that every movie featured on the revived series had to fit within the channel s broad definition of science fiction which included horror and fantasy instead of the varied genres present in past shows but by the final season this restriction seemed to be loosened allowing movies such as girl in gold boots and the joe don baker film final justice in any event the network s vast library of science fiction films provided an

states music radio is a radio format where music is the primary source of broadcast content on both commercial and non commercial stations after the rise of television brought about the decline of old time radio and its dramatic content music formats became one of the dominant forms of radio in many countries though radio drama and comedy continues often on public radio music has been one of the driving factors in the advancement of radio technology from the adoption of wide band fm to the current upswing in digital media music radio and culture music radio particularly top four zero has often acted as both a barometer and an arbiter of musical taste and radio airplay is one of the defining measures of success in the mainstream musical world in fact the rise of rock music to popularity is intimately tied to the history of music radio early forms of rock had languished in poor areas of the south it was enjoyed mostly by rural blacks rock music entered the mainstream during the one nine five zero s because of controversial white djs such as wolfman jack and alan freed with an appreciation for black music for many years many listeners have been dissatisfied with the content of radio programming since the decline of early free form rock radio the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations in the united kingdom was an early symptom of frustration with the often overly safe and occasionally politicized playlists of commercial radio the growth of internet radio from a small experimenter s toy in the mid nine zero s to a huge phenomenon allowing both small do it yourselfers and large commercial stations to make their offerings available worldwide was seen as a threat to over the air music broadcasting and was nearly shut down by onerous licensing demands made by the recording industry meanwhile the rise of satellite radio services as a major competitor have brought many of the advantages of internet radio to an increasingly mobile listening public including lack of censorship greater choice a more eclectic approach to format programming and static free digital sound quality indeed one size fits all programming is no longer seen as tenable by some as the diversity of musical tastes among the listening public have created a proliferation of radio formats in what some might call a form of narrowcasting how it works cost of programming stations usually adopt a music format to gain the greatest number of listeners for the least expense this reasoning is common in both commercial and non commercial stations since the programming content has already been produced all that a station has to provide is the low cost on air programming between records most music radio stations pay licensing fees to licensing agencies such as ascap or bmi as do most commercial businesses that wish to use music as part of their business as a result while most commercial stations might get their music for free they still have to pay royalties to actually play it some small neighborhood sized stations can play unlisted locally produced music and avoid these fees licensing issues nearly destroyed internet radio during the first years of the two one st century in the united states congress intervened to create a royalty structure that while expensive to independent operators running on a shoestring was far less onerous than the scale demanded by the riaa currently one service provider live three six five provides programs that handle licensing issues in addition both xm and sirius provide commercial packages that allow the exclusive use though not rebroadcast of their music programming by businesses license free commercial radio commercial stations charge advertisers for the estimated number of listeners the larger the audience the higher the stations rate card can be for commercial advertising commercial stations program the format of the station to gain as large a slice of the demographic audience as possible a station s value is usually measured as a percentage of market share in a market of a certain size the measurement in u s markets has historically been by arbitron a commercial statistical service that uses listener diaries arbitron diaries were historically collected on thursdays and for this reason most radio stations have run special promotions on thursdays hoping to persuade last minute arbitron diarists to give them a larger market share stations are contractually prohibited from mentioning arbitron on the air market share is not always a consideration because not all radio stations are commercial public radio is funded by government and private donors since most public broadcasting operations don t have to make a profit no commercials are necessary also satellite radio either charges subscribers or is operated by a public broadcasting service therefore satellite radio rarely carries commercials or tries to raise money from donors the lack of commercial interruptions in satellite radio is an important advantage often the only breaks in a satellite music station s programming are for station identification and dj introductions internet radio stations exist that follow all of these plans much early commercial radio was completely freeform this changed drastically with the payola scandals of the one nine five zero s as a result djs seldom have complete programming freedom occasionally a special situation or highly respected long established personality is given such freedom most programming is done by the program director program directors may work for the station or at a central location run by a corporate network the dj s function is generally reduced to introducing and playing songs many stations target younger listeners because advertisers believe that advertising can change a younger person s product choice older people are thought to be less easy to change programming music radio has several possible arrangements originally it had blocks of sponsored airtime that played music from a live orchestra in the one nine three zero s phonograph records especially the single let a disc jockey introduce individual songs or introduce blocks of songs since then the program has been arranged so that commercials are followed by the content that is most valuable to the audience because dead air does not attract listeners the station tries to fill its broadcast day with sound audiences will only tolerate a certain number of commercials before tuning away in some regions government regulators specify how many commercials can be played in a given hour programming is different for non traditional broadcasting the jack fm format eliminates djs entirely as do many internet radio stations the music is simply played if it is announced it is by rds for fm broadcast or id three tags for internet broadcast satellite radio usually uses djs but their programming blocks are longer and not distinguished much by the time of day in addition receivers usually display song titles so announcing them is not needed internet and satellite broadcasting are not considered public media so treaties and statutes concerning obscenity transmission of ciphers and public order do not apply to those formats so satellite and internet radio are free to provide sexually explicit coarse and political material typical providers include playboy radio uncensored rap and hard rock stations and outlaw country music stations the wide reach and selective non broadcast usage of the internet allows programmers access to special interest audiences as a result both mainstream and narrow interest webcasts flourish in particular electronic music stations are much more common on the internet than they are in satellite or broadcast media jingles are the musical equivalent of neon signs and they can be remarkably beautiful jingles are brief bright pieces of choral music that promote the station s call letters frequency and sometimes disc jockey or program segment jingles were produced for radio stations by commercial speciality services the most famous jingle service was called pams external link based in texas jingles are not as common as they used to be often being replaced by recorded voiceovers sometimes called stingers the station will usually have a policy of announcing time station call letters and frequency as often as six times per hour in order to build station loyalty jingles can very useful for giving the station a branded sound in a pleasant minimal amount of air time the legal requirement for station identification in the u s is once per hour approximately at the top of the hour or at the conclusion of a transmission news time checks real time travel advice and weather reports are often quite valuable to listeners the news headlines and station identification are often given just before a commercial time traffic and weather are given just after the engineer typically sets the station clocks to standard local time each day by listening to wwv or wwvh see atomic clock although valued by commuters and older people these segments are less valued by young people so many stations that prefer to attract young listeners prefer to play music and shorten or omit these segments while most music stations that do offer news reports may simply tear and read news items from the newswires or the internet larger stations generally those affiliated with news talk stations may employ an editor to rewrite headlines and provide summaries of local news the summaries allow more news to fit in less air time some stations can share news collection with tv or newspapers in the same media conglomerate an emerging trend is to use the radio station s web site to provide in depth coverage of news and advertisers head lined on the air similarly many stations contract with agencies such as smartraveler and accuweather for their weather and traffic reports instead of having in house staff to do the job most radio stations maintain a call in telephone line for use during promotions and gags or to take record requests djs generally answer the phone and edit the call during music plays some stations take requests by e mail or even online chat promotions are usually the on air equivalent of lotteries for listeners promotional budgets usually run about one per listener per year in a large market a successful radio station can pay a full time director of promotions and several lotteries per month of vacations automobiles and other prizes lottery items are often bartered from advertisers allowing both companies to charge full prices while incurring wholesale costs for example consider a cruise vacation cruising companies often have unused capacity and when given the choice prefer to pay their bills by bartering vacations since the ship will sail in any case bartered vacations cost the cruise company little or nothing the promotion is itself advertising for the company providing the prize programming by time most music stations have djs that play music from a playlist determined by the program director arranged by blocks of time though practices differ by region and format what follows is a typical arrangement in a north american urban commercial radio station the first block of the day is the drive time block in the early morning typically five or six am to midmorning nine to one one am this block usually includes news bulletins and traffic and weather advisories for commuters as well as light comedy from the morning dj team many shock jocks started as or still work on drive time radio some stations emphasize music and reduce gags and call ins in this period the midday block is mostly music for a period around noon a station may play nonstop music or go to an all request format for people eating lunch in the early evening the evening rush hour programming resembles the midday programming but adds traffic and weather advisories for commuters some stations insert a short snippet of standup comedy around five o clock when commuters leave work the evening block if present returns to music the overnight programming is generally low key music with quiet announcing some stations play documentaries or even infomercials while some others play syndicated djs like delilah it is not uncommon to play more adventurous selections during late night programming blocks since late night is generally not considered significant for ratings weekends especially sundays often carry different programming common syndicated programming includes music countdown shows from djs such as rick dees and casey kasem retrospective shows and world music such as the putumayo world music hour stations may carry shows with different genres of music such as blues or jazz community affairs and religious programming is often on sunday mornings in addition weekend evenings are particularly specialized a dance station might have a sponsored dance party at a local club or a classical station may play an opera many music stations in the united states perform news and timechecks only sparingly preferring to put more music on the air news is often restricted to the talk heavy commuting hours the bbc takes a different approach with all of its stations giving news updates bbc one xtra produces its own news segments under the name tx music formats some well known music radio formats are top four zero freeform rock and aor album oriented rock it turns out that most other stations such as rhythm top four zero stations could sometimes be better described as top two zero stations they would aggressively skirt listener boredom to play only the most popular singles top four zero radio would punctuate the music with jingles promotions gags call ins and requests brief news time and weather announcements and most importantly advertising the distinguishing mark of a traditional top four zero station was the use of a hyperexcited disc jockey and high tempo jingles the format was invented in the us and today can be heard world wide todd storz and gordon mclendon invented top four zero radio bill drake and rick sklar have had a lasting modern influence this is an excellent brief history of the format variants and hybrids include the freeform like jack fm mentioned below under freeform rock and the mix formats mentioned below under oldies top four zero music is heavily criticized by some music fans as being repetitive and of low quality and is almost exclusively dominated by large media conglomerates such as clear channel communications and cbs corporation top four zero tends to be underrepresented on the internet being mostly the domain of commercial broadcasters such as virgin radio uk some of the most famous top four zero stations of have
